         A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like
         these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart.
         I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was
         created for the bliss of souls like mine.
         that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single
         stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater
         artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around
          me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable
           foliage of my trees,dude, dude, dude, dude,dude, dude, dude, dude, dude
         , dude, dude, dude, dude,dude, dude, dude, dude,dude, dude, dude, dude, dude
